# TasksOrganizer
## About the Project
Tasks Organizer is basically a **to-do list web application**. Tasks Organizer uses  **snowpack bundler** to combine many JavaScript code files into a single one that is production-ready loadable in the browser. I created Task Organizer to learn about **typescript**. The main screen of the project is shown below.

A user can add a new task by simply press the **plus** button.
